INTROSPECTION



WHY MUST WE CHOOSE YOU?



I may not have much coding background and all, but I am confident that I can learn them, execute them and will definetly give my 100% in doing the work. So, you can choose me as ther is a quote saying "Hard work beats talent when talent does'nt work hard".


What is your plan for next six months?



My plan for next six months is to first explore things and see myself where I can perfectly fit into, and just give my best in both academics and improvising my skill. I need to develop a lot of skills and help myself to go good on a daily basis.



How would you contribute back to the club?



After learning whatever I can from the club I would give all my knowledge and expertise back to the club so that the club could grow even more and i would help my fellow club members in any problems they face in the club . I will also help my upcoming juniors in achieving their goals as my seniors and friends did for me. 



Do you have any feedback for the selection process?



Selection process was good in terms of getting an overview about few things without going too deep into it.
