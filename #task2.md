The first step of this task is to clone my git profile using git clone command
Then new directory was asked to made named "solution".
Now the first part of the password contains:
    1)multiply smallest number by 44 = 264
    2)Bohrium atomic mass is 264
    3)Atomic number is 107
    so, part1 of the password is 107
For part2 of the password we need to find :
    1)HCF of 336 and 702 ie., 6 and go to 6th numbered folder
   2)Now fourth digit of pi ie., 1. 1 numbered file was copied to solution directory and named as part2.txt
Now while enterning  git log into the terminal we had committed the work which has been done till now
Part3 of file consist of the file in terminal hunt directory in xx/x.txt format where xxx is lowest 3 digit prime number
The lowest 3 digit prime number is 101 so the file is 10/01.
"cd Documents/GitHub/TerminalHunt/10/3.txt Documents/GitHub/TerminalHunt/solution" by this command we are copying the file to solution direcotr.
Now the 3.txt file is renamed to part3.txt by the command "mv 3.txt part3.txt"

So the hunt now is for the last file and to that for that we checked all the branches with the command "git branch -a"
with "git checkout asia" as asia is the largest continent
Godess of war from greek mythology is athens "find . -athens" to ifnd the file athens.
Now we need to checkout from asia to main by the command "git checkout main".
Now we need to combine all the files into password.txt "cat part1.txt part2.txt part3.txt part4.txt >password.txt".
SO finally all the files are removed and concatenated to pasword.txt file.
